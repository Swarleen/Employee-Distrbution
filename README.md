## Power BI Report Walkthrough

## Limitations

While this dashboard offers valuable insights, it's essential to be aware of its limitations:

- Some records with negative ages were excluded during querying (967 records). The ages used were 18 years and above.
- Some term dates were too far into the future and were not included in the analysis (1599 records). Only term dates up to the current date were considered.


I hope you find this HR Data Dashboard insightful and valuable for your organization's HR planning and decision-making processes.
